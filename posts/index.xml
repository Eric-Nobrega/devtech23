Previous to this post, I had been working on devTech23 everyday, however, due to my workload at university, aswell as preparing and fitting in time for internship applications/interviews, I have not been as consistent as I would have liked.
However&amp;hellip;
I am feeling alot better and more motivated to continue on, I will continue on where I left off which was popular React Libraries such as Redux/RTK and once I have covered this, I am planning on exploring the React Ecosystem with frameworks such as Next.</description></item><item><title>devTech #6: Evaluating My Progress</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-6/</guid><description>Which topics have I studied/am I currently studying? Initially, my studies have been focused on front-end technologies since that&amp;rsquo;s where my interest lies. I have gained knowledge in the following topics/technologies:
HTML Vanilla CSS Vanilla JavaScript ReactJS (currently learning) TailwindCSS TypeScript (currently studying) As a result, my confidence as a developer has increased, and my knowledge has expanded. My goal is to build a mini-consolidation project using ReactJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, implementing various advanced features such as multiple react hooks and third-party libraries.</description></item><item><title>devTech #5: React &amp; AWS</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-5/</guid><description>ReactJS It has been 3 days since my last post, as well as 3 days since I have begun this ReactJS course.

It is approximately 13 days into devTech 23. I would say that I have indeed stuck to my plan and have been successfully covering the technologies listed on devTech23&amp;rsquo;s homepage. I have made several modifications to my plan, and over time, have gotten better with my time management and how I balance my studying.
What technologies have I completed? At the moment, I have covered:</description></item><item><title>devTech #3: First Week Almost Completed!</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-3/</guid><description>What have I been studying? As mentioned in my previous post, I have decided to start at the foundations of front-end development and have been completing a Udemy Course that provides a deep dive into HTMl &amp;amp; CSS. As of now, I have completed roughly 7.5 hours of the course. I am most likely going to use the remainder of the course as a learning resource rather than focus on completing it since it dives slightly too in depth for what my aims are.</description></item><item><title>devTech #2: First Session Summary, Study Plan, Certificates</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-2/</guid><description>My first session - A Summary I aim to become a well rounded developer, knowledgeable in multiple fields of development, however, I aim to specialise in front-end development, therefore, I figured it only made sense to begin here. I have started from the basics, including how the internet works, the history and the technology behind it.
I am currently completing a 14.5 Hour Udemy course that delivers a deep dive into HTML &amp;amp; CSS.</description></item><item><title>devTech #1: My First Post</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started this site for several reasons.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
