As mentioned in my previous post, I have decided to start at the foundations of front-end development and have been completing a Udemy Course that provides a deep dive into HTMl &amp;amp; CSS. As of now, I have completed roughly 7.5 hours of the course. I am most likely going to use the remainder of the course as a learning resource rather than focus on completing it since it dives slightly too in depth for what my aims are.</description></item><item><title>devTech #2: First Session Summary, Study Plan, Certificates</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-2/</guid><description>My first session - A Summary I aim to become a well rounded developer, knowledgeable in multiple fields of development, however, I aim to specialise in front-end development, therefore, I figured it only made sense to begin here.

I am currently completing a 14.5 Hour Udemy course that delivers a deep dive into HTML &amp;amp; CSS.</description></item><item><title>devTech #1: My First Post</title><link>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eric-nobrega.github.io/devtech23/posts/post-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started this site for several reasons.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
