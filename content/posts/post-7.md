### What happened?
Previous to this post, I had been working on devTech23 everyday, however, due to my workload at university, 
aswell as preparing and fitting in time for internship applications/interviews, I have not been as consistent
as I would have liked.

However...

I am feeling alot better and more motivated to continue on, I will continue on where I left off which was
popular React Libraries such as Redux/RTK and once I have covered this, I am planning on exploring the React
Ecosystem with frameworks such as Next.JS. I have also decided to quite JavaScript...AND replace it with TypeScript.
The benefits of TypeScript speak for itself and there is rly no choice to be made here, it is the clear choice and language of the future.

### What to expect?
I will be posting tonight/tomorrow night my summary of my first devTech23 study session.
