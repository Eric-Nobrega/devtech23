### Have I stuck to my plan?
It is approximately 13 days into devTech 23. I would say that I have indeed stuck to my plan and have been successfully covering the technologies listed on devTech23's homepage. I have made several modifications to my plan, and over time, have gotten better with my time management and how I balance my studying.

### What technologies have I completed?
At the moment, I have covered: 
- HTML (Deep Dive (Semantic HTML))
- Vanilla CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design, Mobile First, etc)
- Vanilla JavaScript (Hoisting, Modular JS, Event Bubbling, etc)
- ViteJS
- Node Package Manager
- Git Version Control

I have also recreated devTech23 using HTML, CSS, JS. This was to simplfy solidify my knowledge with these technolgies. I could have created a much larger scale project, however, I plan on not spending too much time with these technolgies given I already understand the fundamentals and would like to spend my time covering technolgies within the React Ecosystem.

### What am I studying right now?
I am now currenly studying React using a popular Udemy Course. This course will cover:
- React
- React Router
- Context API
- Redux
- NextJS

Once I have completed this course, and have a few React Projects under my belt, I will cover TypeScript and then I hopefully, will be able to confidently use React /w TypeScript as my main framwork for frontend development.

I am also studying for my AWS CCP Certification and have been following a course on udemy for this.

This concludes my fourth post here on devTech 23. I plan on posting regularly moving forward.
