#### My first session - A Summary
I aim to become a well rounded developer, knowledgeable in multiple fields of development, however, I aim to specialise in front-end development, therefore, I figured it only made sense to begin here. I have started from the basics, including how the internet works, the history and the technology behind it. 

I am currently completing a 14.5 Hour Udemy course that delivers a deep dive into HTML & CSS. I chose this course as it is suitable for individuals with previous experience of these technologies, and will help remove any bad habits in place. I have completed roughly 1 hour of this course so far and am enjoying it. I aim to have this completed in the coming days. I am attempting to cover the foundations relatively fast so I can study harder topics that I find more interesting. 

#### My study strategy
My study strategy is to follow the several roadmap available on roadmaps.sh. I will find a structured course on Udemy and completed extra excercises and projects on each new topic I learn. This is my strategy as of now, however, I may make amendments as I learn more.

#### Certifications
I have added another goal to my list of goals for this year. I am aiming to become AWS certified. I will first aim for the AWS CP Certifcate, and then study and attain the AWS Cloud Developer Associate Certificate. 

This concludes my second post here on devTech 23. I plan on posting regularly moving forward.
