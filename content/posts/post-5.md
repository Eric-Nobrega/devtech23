### ReactJS
It has been 3 days since my last post, as well as 3 days since I have begun this ReactJS course. I am approximately 28.46% (175/615) complete. The topics that I have covered so far include:
- React Core Syntax & JSX
- Working with Components
- Working with Data
- Handling Events
- Updating the UI
- Working with State (useState Hook)
- Dealing with Dynamic Lists of Content
- Conditional Rendering
- Conditional & Dynmamic Styles
- Styled Components
- CSS Modules

It has been good to cover some familar topics, aswell as some totally new topics. I have found getting back into the React way of thinking fairly easy and am dealing with the new topics well. I will be completing multiple small scale projects that will make use of the topics that I have learnt in this course. 

From the list above, I was familar with all the topics, except the last 3 topics:
- Conditional & Dynmamic Styles
- Styled Components
- CSS Modules

During the course, I have briefly covered these topics, however, I defitley plan on learning more about these technologies and including them in my future projects. I can really see the benefits of utilising CSS in this form, the main advantage is the ability to have very lean react components since the CSS is totally seperated. It also really helps with preventing css class names clashing since Styled Components & CSS Modules generate a unique class hash.

### AWS
I am approximately 15% complete with the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner course. I have covered the following topics:
- The concept of cloud computing (theory)
- AWS Service - IAM

My experience with this course has been very good. It's quite refreshing to study topics that aren't so code/programming related, and more so general IT. I am currently on the AWS Service - EC2. I am aiming to be certified as a AWS Certified Cloud Practioner in approximately 2 months time. 

### Summary & Thoughts of Project: devTech23
I am content with the progress so far, however, I am always aiming for better. I feel more confident with the technoligies that I covered, and am studying. Once the course of React is completed, I will be creating a consolidation project that will include the majority of the topics I have covered.
