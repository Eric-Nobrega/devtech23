#### What have I been studying?
As mentioned in my previous post, I have decided to start at the foundations of front-end development
and have been completing a Udemy Course that provides a deep dive into HTMl & CSS. As of now,
I have completed roughly 7.5 hours of the course. I am most likely going to use the remainder of 
the course as a learning resource rather than focus on completing it since it dives slightly too
in depth for what my aims are. I definitely understand HTML much better know and I understand the
importance of the use of semantic HTML rather than just overusing non-semantic elements such as
divs. I have also covered the foundations of CSS and am finishing up with taking a deep dive into
CSS grid. To solidify my knowledge on these two topics, I plan on creating a fully responsive
website that only uses HTML + CSS, I will aim for the code to be very clean and make sure that it
uses semantic HTML. 

Once this small project/excercise is completed, I will be moving forward to JavaScript and I have
found a Udemy Course that provides an interesting curriculum.

#### Main Issues I have come up against
- Staying Focused On Topics Previously Covered
- Balancing Other Topics (AWS Certificate, Other Roadmaps)

This concludes my third post here on devTech 23. I plan on posting regularly moving forward.
