REFACTOR USING CHATGPT-3

### Which topics have I studied/am I currently studying?

Initially, my studies have been focused on front-end technologies since that's where my interest lies. I have gained knowledge in the following topics/technologies:

- HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- ReactJS (currently learning)
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript (currently studying)

As a result, my confidence as a developer has increased, and my knowledge has expanded. My goal is to build a mini-consolidation project using ReactJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, implementing various advanced features such as multiple react hooks and third-party libraries.
