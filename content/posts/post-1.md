I started this site for several reasons. <!--more-->I am currently at the second stage/year of a BSc Computer Science Course, and I enjoy learning more outside of the classroom. I have been doing this for a while now, learning mainly technologies inside the JavaScript ecosystem: JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS and more. I plan to continue this habit in 2023, and figure having a site where I can document my learnings and projects would be a good idea.

#### What can you expect from devTech 23?

1. Learning Reports on Different Technologies.
2. Project Showcases.
3. Programming Tutorials.
4. Anything coding related.

This concludes my first post here on devTech 23. I plan on posting regularly moving forward.
